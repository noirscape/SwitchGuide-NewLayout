If you get stuck, we have a Discord guild where you can get help.

Below you can find the rules of this Discord guild.

Please familiarize yourself with these rules.

## Rules

0. **Don't be a dick.**
1. Do not assist users with piracy, wether this is in public or in DMs.
  - Do not upload or link to ROMs/CIAs/ISOs/NSPs.
  - Do not post cryptographic system keys.
  - Due to their main usecase being piracy, assisting users with the following software is also forbidden (note: discussion outside of assistance channels is permitted within reason):
    - CDN downloaders.
    - Team Xecuter products.
    - Sigpatches on Atmosphere.
    - NSP installers.
2. Do not assist or advice users programs that will result in system bans.
  - Do not assist users with bypassing bans imposed by Nintendo.
3. If you have a question to ask, just ask it. Asking if you can ask a question just wastes everyones time.
4. While the focus of this guild is the Nintendo Switch, you can attempt to get support for other systems in #not-switch-systems. That said, if you seek extended support with other Nintendo systems, please refer to [Nintendo Homebrew](https://discord.gg/C29hYvh).
5. If you have suggestions for the guide, post them in #suggestions or on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/noirscape/SwitchGuide/issues).
 - Do not post support questions on the Issue Tracker.
6. This guild will occasionally make use of @everyone pings to notify users of updates to the Guide or software included in the Guide. Complaining about this pings will net you warnings.
7. Do not post NSFW content.
  - This includes extreme fetish art or gore.
8. We desire to have a welcoming and open environment. Harassment or usage of slurs of any kind is not tolerated. If a user is harassing you, whether in public or in DMs, please message staff with the evidence.
  - Irony is often not discernible from the real thing. In the case of [Poe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law), staff will act as if it is completely genuine.
9. If you have an issue with staff behavior or wish to appeal warnings, please use #meta . Staff will not issue warnings for issues raised in a civil manner. Raising issues in a non-civil manner may result in sanctions on your ability to post in this server.
  - If you lose access to #meta, you are no longer able to appeal warns.
10. Do not advertise in our server without asking staff first. 
  - This includes posting invites to other guilds.
11. Do not break or encourage other members to break the Discord TOS.
  - You must be 13 years or older to use Discord.
12. Playing a rules lawyer will not result in sanctions being removed and may result in other sanctions.
13. Backseat moderators are not welcome. If staff is already handling the issue, interference from other users is not welcome.
  - In a similar fashion, asking staff to impose certain sanctions on other members will result in the same sanction being placed on that member.
14. Staff has the final say on everything, even if not covered or contradictory to the aforementioned rules.

In addition, your messages _will_ be logged for moderation purposes.
