## Former credits

Due to changes in the guide, these people originally had a hand in making the guide possible, but for whatever reason their input is no longer visible in the guide.

- [Jisagi](https://github.com/jisagi) and [ZetaDesigns](https://github.com/ZetaDesigns), originally provided the layout.
- [TomGER](https://github.com/tumGER) for the compiled build of nx-hbloader and Kosmos, which an early version of this guide made use of.
