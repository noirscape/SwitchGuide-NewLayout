Making a NAND dump is *essential*. If you damage your device, you will likely need a NAND dump to recover from it. Not having a NAND dump means you cannot recover from a brick. Making a NAND dump takes a while, but you will *need* one and going without is setting yourself up to fail.

Make sure to backup your NAND in a safe place.
