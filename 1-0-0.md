title: 1.0.0 RCM
---

To enter RCM and launch CFW on firmware 1.0.0, it is possible to use an nsp called reboot_to_rcm, which can be launched by using PegaSwitch. This implementation does not require a hardmod and can be ran on any device running 1.0.0. At the moment, a lot of homebrew does not work on 1.0.0, including the latest version of the homebrew launcher. You will need to use an older version of the Homebrew Launcher to get homebrew running.

### What you will need

- **Advanced computer knowledge. Unlike the main guide, this requires you to have at least a slight familiarity with the terminal and you should know what IP and DNS are.**
- A Japanese copy of Puyo Puyo Tetris S.
- A computer running Windows, macOS or Linux. Unlike the main guide, Android and chromeOS are unsupported.
- [nx-hbmenu](https://github.com/switchbrew/nx-hbmenu/releases/tag/v1.0.0){: target="_blank"}. You will need the 1.0.0 release (which is linked). Later versions of nx-hbmenu don't work with 1.0.0 systems.
- The latest version of [node.js](https://nodejs.org){: target="_blank"}
- The latest version of [PegaSwitch](https://github.com/reswitched/PegaSwitch){: target="_blank"}.
- The latest version of [reboot_to_rcm.nsp](https://github.com/pixel-stuck/reboot_to_rcm/releases/latest){: target="_blank"}
- [nsp.js](assets/nsp.js){: target="_blank"} (Press CTRL-S or Apple Key-S to save this file.)
- The latest version of [git](https://git-scm.com/){: target="_blank"}. Make sure that when installing you select to add git to the PATH (the default option should be good).

### Setting up PegaSwitch

You will only need to do this step once for each device you want to use to boot CFW.
{: .notice--primary}

- Open the PegaSwitch folder using a file explorer.
- Put `nsp.js` into the `usefulscripts` folder.
- Open a Terminal/CMD window (Windows users should shift+right click and do "open command window here" in the PegaSwitch folder and skip the next step.)
- Enter `cd ` and then drag the PegaSwitch folder on the terminal window and press enter. Make sure to add the space after `cd` before dragging the PegaSwitch folder on the window!
- Enter `npm i`. This will install the dependencies needed for PegaSwitch to function.

### Setting up your SD

- Place `hbmenu.nro` on the root of your SD card.
- Place `reboot_to_rcm.nsp` on the root of your SD card.

### Setting your Switch DNS to PegaSwitch

If you connect to a new WiFi network or your computer has a dynamic internal IP, you will need to redo this step each time you launch CFW.
{: .notice--primary}

1. Open a Terminal/CMD window (Windows users should shift+right click and do "open command window here" in the PegaSwitch folder and skip the next step.)
2. Enter `cd ` and then drag the PegaSwitch folder on the terminal window and press enter. Make sure to add the space after `cd` before dragging the PegaSwitch folder on the window!
3. The following command differs slightly on wether you use macOS/Linux or Windows:
  - Windows: Enter `node start.js` and press enter.
  - macOS/Linux: Enter `sudo node start.js` and press enter.
4. Note down the displayed IP address.
5. Press Ctrl-C (for mac: Apple key-C) to stop the program.
6. On your Switch, go to the settings, go to your currently connected network and select Change Settings.
7. Change both the Primary and the Secondary DNS to the IP address you noted down earlier.

If the fake news entry made by installFakeNews.js becomes inaccessible for whatever reason, you will have to redo this step.
{: .notice--primary}

1. Open a Terminal/CMD window (Windows users should shift+right click and do "open command window here" in the PegaSwitch folder and skip the next step.)
2. Enter `cd ` and then drag the PegaSwitch folder on the terminal window and press enter. Make sure to add the space after `cd` before dragging the PegaSwitch folder on the window!
3. On your computer, start PegaSwitch by running one of the following commands:
  - Windows: Enter `node start.js --webapplet` and press enter.
  - macOS/Linux: Enter `sudo node start.js --webapplet` and press enter.
4. On your Switch, open Puyo Puyo Tetris S.
5. Press `A`, then `R`, then `A`.
6. Touch on `お問い合わせ先`, then touch the SEGA logo in the bottom left corner.
7. Your Terminal/CMD window should indicate that your Switch has succesfully connected to PegaSwitch.
8. In your Terminal/CMD window, type `evalfile usefulscripts/installFakeNews.js` and press enter. This will install a fake entry to the news applet which you can launch to go into RCM in the future.
9. Type `evalfile usefulscripts/nsp.js` and press enter. 
10. Press the Home button to exit Puyo Puyo Tetris and open the Album applet.
11. Your Switch will now reboot to RCM. You can follow the [main guide](index.html){: target="_blank"} to set up Atmosphère as per usual.

### FAQ

**Q: The Homebrew Menu crashes!**

A: See below. The guide uses an older version of the Homebrew menu that is technically still compiled against a broken version of libnx, but it's stable enough to still work on 1.0.0.

**Q: Homebrew application X doesn't work/crashes a lot!**

A: The reason for this is because the development library for the Nintendo Switch, libnx, currently does not support 1.0.0. This results in any homebrew compiled against a version of the lib that has broken 1.0.0 support not working. Your best bet is to wait for Atmosphères planned emuNAND solution (known as Thermosphère) or use old versions of homebrew. Thermosphère is planned for Atmosphère 1.0.0.
